Subject: Data Quality Insights and Key Findings for Business Strategy
Dear Stakeholder's Name,

I hope you're doing well. As part of our data investigation, I’ve analyzed our transaction, user, and product datasets to identify key trends and ensure data quality for business insights. Below is a summary of my findings:

Key Data Quality Issues & Outstanding Questions
Missing and inconsistent data were found across multiple datasets. In the Users dataset, several entries are missing birth dates, which affects age-based analyses. In the Products dataset, the brand column contained "Unknown" values, which have now been replaced with the most frequent brand in the respective category.

Potential duplicate records were found in the transactions, which may inflate reported sales figures. Do we have any internal process to validate and remove duplicate transaction records?

Some transactions reference products that are not listed in the Products table. Would it be possible to confirm if these missing product records should be included, or if they represent discontinued items?

Interesting Trend in the Data
One notable insight is that a small group of power users is responsible for a disproportionately high number of transactions. The top 10% of users account for nearly 50% of all transactions. These users tend to shop at the same five to seven stores and prefer specific brands and product categories. This suggests strong brand loyalty and repeat purchasing behavior, which presents an opportunity for targeted engagement campaigns to drive further revenue.

Would it be helpful to conduct a deep dive on these power users to tailor promotions, loyalty rewards, or product recommendations?

Request for Action
To improve data accuracy and maximize business insights, I would appreciate your guidance on the following:

Clarification on duplicate transactions – Should we filter out suspected duplicate entries?

Missing product information – Do we have access to a more complete product catalog to cross-check missing barcodes?

Power user engagement strategy – Would the team be interested in exploring personalized offers for high-frequency shoppers?

I’m happy to schedule a quick discussion to walk through these insights and next steps. Let me know what works best.

Looking forward to your thoughts.

Best Regards,
Bhavana Sriharshitha Abbina

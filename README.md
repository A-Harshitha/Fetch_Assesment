## üîç Data Cleaning Process
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Missing Values**
- Replaced missing **birthdates** using the median birth year.
- Filled missing **store names** with `"Unknown Store"`.
- Replaced `"Unknown"` values in the **BRAND** column with the most common brand in the same **CATEGORY_1**.
- Dropped transactions with missing **USER_ID** or **BARCODE** since they are essential.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Type Standardization**
- Converted `PURCHASE_DATE` and `BIRTH_DATE` to **datetime format**.
- Ensured numerical columns like `FINAL_SALE` and `FINAL_QUANTITY` were correctly formatted.
